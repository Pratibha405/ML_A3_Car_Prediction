Model A3: Classification Approach
In Model A3, we use a classification approach to categorize car prices. The model is evaluated using metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Accuracy, Macro Average, and Weighted Average. We use Ridge Linear Regression to compute the best model, compare loss, and use that model to predict car prices.
